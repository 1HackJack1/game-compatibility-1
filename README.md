# Cxbx-Reloaded game-compatibility project

This project is intended to gather all compatibility reports for Cxbx-Reloaded.

(Cxbx-Reloaded is an original Xbox emulator, see [the Cxbx-Reloaded project on GitHub](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded).)

This project is NOT intended for issues that are emulation-related.
Emulation-related issues must be submitted to the Cxbx-Reloaded project itself.

In this game-compatibility project, each title is assigned ONE issue.
Do not create duplicate issues (first, search if a title already has an issue).
Duplicate reports will be merged into one.
Duplicate issues are the only ones that will be closed.
Unique game-compatibility issues will not be closed.

Issue titles MUST mention the official title name,
followed by a Title ID in square brackets, nothing else.

Issue labels are used to indicate compatibility-attributes.
Issue labels show the compatibility for the latest tested build.

Adding screenshots to issues is allowed.
Don't add most than 8 screenshots per issue (unless more are absolutely required).


These rules are subject to change.
Maintainers will be appointed to enforce these guidelines to all issues.

Our thanks go out to everyone showing an interest and/or investing time and effort in our project : Thank you very much!
- The Cxbx-Reloaded dev team.
